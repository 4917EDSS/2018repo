# This is an example of what the syslog configuration file in the RoboRio 
# should look like (/etc/syslog-ng.d/4917syslog.conf).  The file should get
# auto-generated if it doesn't exist (see our LogOutput.cpp)
#
# It sends syslog messages (syslog() or vsyslog() C++ function or logger shell 
# command) to the host PC at the following address.  The PC can get the
# messages using a client like Visual Syslog listening on port 514.
#
# IMPORTANT:  In order for the robot code to be able to change the destination
#             IP address, 4917syslog.conf must be readable and writable by any
#             Linux user.  To do that, use this command when logged in as admin.
#
#             chmod 777 /etc/syslog-ng.d
#
# This file is an extension to /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
